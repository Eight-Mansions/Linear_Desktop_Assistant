# Timing Values
# *************

# Work length (minutes) sets the time from starting work until the assistant prompts for a break.
# Default: 60 minutes
WORK_LENGTH=60

# Break length (minutes) sets the time from break start until the assistant prompts to start working again.
# Default: 10 minutes
BREAK_LENGTH=10

# Stand frequency determines how frequently the assistant will ask you to stand up.
# The frequency relates to the number of work cycles that have happened, so a value of two means every
# other work cycle will prompt for a standing section.
# Example: a STAND_FREQUENCY of 2 means that on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, etc work cycle, a stand prompt will occur.
# A STAND_FREQUENCY of 1 means that every work cycle will have a stand prompt.

# To disable this feature, set the STAND_FREQUENCY to 0.
# Default: 2
STAND_FREQUENCY=2

# Stand time indicates how long a standing section should be timed for. Standing always happens at the back
# half of the work cycle. So if a work cycle is 60 minutes and the stand time is 20 minutes, then the standing
# prompt will occur at 40 minutes and last until it's time for a break
# Default: 30
STAND_TIME=30
